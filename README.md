Transforming images and feeds to Ascii Art
=============================================

All code interfacing with the webcam is based on the opencv work done by Chimpler here: https://github.com/chimpler/blog-scala-javacv

Exporting out to gif file format based on the collected results from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/777947/creating-animated-gif-with-imageio

I set out to start and end a project in less than a week of time.
I am using the output of this program as an obfuscated webcam stream to add onto my Twitch stream at twitch.tv/malvirus
